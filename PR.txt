Title: docs: document connection parameter usage
Body:
Problem:
Docstrings did not explain optional database connection parameter.
Approach:
Clarified how passing a connection affects `get_db` and `init_database`.
Alternatives considered:
Leave existing minimal documentation.
Risk & mitigations:
Caller-provided connections might be closed unintentionally; code now only closes when it creates the connection.
Affected files:
- src/professional_invoice_manager/db.py
Test results (from COMMANDS.sh):
- `python -m flake8 src tests`
- `pytest tests` (fails: ImportError: cannot import name 'InvoiceDetailWidget')
Refs: #000
